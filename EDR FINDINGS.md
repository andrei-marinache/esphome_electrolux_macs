# Findings

I had to reverse engineer most of the infos below, because very little information is available.

### Controller

The dryers are very simple creatures, that don't need much control. 
Basically you need a motor and a heat source and you're done. Of course there are different variants like the ones with heat exchanger, but they don't need very different controlling.
Also Electrolux and its brands (AEG, Zanussi, ...) use very much the same controller boards.

What I have is from an older series that use the EDR1x type controllers. They can be connected to many kinds of user interfaces. What I have is called "Blue Fire Inspiration TC3".

The main controller and the front panel is separated. They are connected with one 4-pin cable that I think is called MACS.

### L1. MACS

Actually this is similar to UART with some quirks.

* One bidirectional data line
* Inverted logic level
* 5V level
* It uses *even* parity, which is unusual
* Usually there are two or more MACS connectors on the boards that are all connected

The MACS port is the interconnect between the boards and also there are the NIU and NIUX Wi-Fi modules that also connects here.
The pinout from the [NIU User Manual](https://fccid.io/2ABHC-5430042/User-Manual/User-manual-2359011.pdf) shows the same pinout that I found. 
Also the Electrolux's debugger tool's (called Sidekick) [docs](https://sidekick.electrolux.com/sidekickportal/Media/ContentImages/AMITechnicalGuide/AMI%20Technical%20Guide%20v1.1.pdf) have this pinout on page 15.

The suitable connectors are the Stocko MFMP 7238-004-061-960-000-00-G and Lumberg 3517-04-K01 (RAST 2.5, 4-pin). These were mentioned in the docs thus the keying should match with the connector.

Pinout:
```
1 - +12V
  --key--
2 - +5V
3 - Data
4 - GND
```

Currently I only want to listen on the bus so I connected the line to the Rx only.

### L2. Framing

Two types of frames:

1. Message frame
2. ACK frame

Message frame format: `9C <target> <source> <length> <data>... <checksum>` 
where target, source, length, checksum are 1 bytes.

In the MACS / DAAS protocols, every panel has its own 1-byte address. In my situation, the main board is `0x22` and the front panel is `0x2A`. Also one can send broadcast message with the target address `0x00`.

ACK frame format: `98 <received data checksum> <checksum>` 
where the received data checksum (I think) nost be calculated from the received data and this frame has its own checksum too. Broadcasted frames don't get ACK replies.

### Messages

I found some meanings of the values by trial and error.

Below all the numbers are purely the data field inside the message frame. All hex values.

```
10 - ???
   00 - ??? (broadcasted at power on)
      13 - ??? (when sent by the front panel)
      17 - ??? (when sent by the controller)
   01 - ??? (sent directly from front panel to controller)
```

```
11 - ???
   00 - (sent by the front panel at power up)
      55 46 43 31 4D 31 30 34 - sw version "UFC1M104" as shown on the board too
                              58 D9 83 4C
   01 - (sent by the controller at power up)
```
