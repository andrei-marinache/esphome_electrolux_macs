## EW8W261B washer-dryer (PerfectCare 800)

Captured on the bus between controller `21` and front panel `2A`, each value checked against the display.
Indexes are into `data` (`data[0]` = message type).

Program set frame (`50 03 ...`):

| Byte | Bits | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| `[2]` | | wash temperature, °C |
| `[3]` | `0x7F` | spin speed / 50 |
| `[3]` | `0x80` | washing off (dry only); `[4]` `0x01` always changes together with it |
| `[5]` | `0x01` | anti-crease |
| `[5]` | `0x20` | Time Manager level 1 |
| `[6]` | `0x04` / `0x10` / `0x20` | stain / extra rinse / soft plus (same as EWX14) |
| `[7]` | `0x80` | pre-wash (same as EWX14) |
| `[7]` | `0x1B` | Time Manager: `01` = 5 bars, `02` = 4, `08` = 3, `10` = 2, `00` = 1 (with `[5]` `0x20`) |
| `[8]` | `0x80` | drying on |
| `[8]` | `0x40` | auto dry (otherwise timed dry) |
| `[8]` | `0x03` | dryness level: `0` = extra dry, `1` = cupboard dry, `2` = iron dry |
| `[9]` | | timed dry minutes (+5 per button press) |
| `[11]` | | start delay, x30 min (`[9]` on EWX14) |
| `[12]` | | program = position of the selector, 1-based |

Time Manager is only offered on programs 1-3 and 6 (FreshScent, where `[4]` `0x80`/`0x40`/`0x20` = 3/2/1 bars). There is no availability bit: other programs still send default `[7]` values (Sportswear `10`, OneGo 4h `08`), so the level is ignored there.

`56 03 04 hh ll xx yy`: `hh ll` is the weighed laundry in grams (500 g steps, same as the display; `FFFF` after a cycle), `xx` looks like the program's maximum load in kg x10 (Cotton `64`, Synthetics `28`, FreshScent `0A`, OneGo 4h `32`). The controller sends it every time the weight changes while idle; a `56 03 08 00` follows each update.
On Cotton the program time follows the weight in 1 kg steps (119 min empty, 132 min at 4 kg, 192 min at 4.5 kg, 233 min at 10 kg), with no hysteresis.

The OneGo programs (13, 14) wash and dry with drying fixed by the program; `[8]` is `81` on OneGo 4h and `91` on OneGo 1h, so it doesn't tell them apart from timed drying. `[8]` `0x10` is also set on Synthetics, Wool and Sportswear with drying off; its meaning is unknown.

State frame (`52 00 ...`), checked over a full OneGo 1h wash + dry cycle:

| Byte | Value / bits | Meaning |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `[2]` | `01` `02` `03` `04` `06` `0B` | idle, running, finished, paused, waiting for door unlock, off (same as EWX14) |
| `[3]` | `02` `03` `04` `05` | wash, rinse, spin, **drying** (`05` is new) |
| `[4]` | `08` `10` `20` | changes within a phase: early spin, near the end of drying, finished; meaning unknown |
| `[5]` | `0x01` | door locked (EWX14 code reads bits 0-1 clear as locked; inverted here) |
| `[5]` | `0x02` | set for about a second while the door locks or unlocks |
| `[5]` | `0x04` | drum turning; follows the inverter speed |
| `[5]` | `0x20` | water in the drum: set after each fill, cleared by the following drain |
| `[7]` | `0x80` | drain pump: pulses at every drain and through the spin |

No fill valve bit was found. The inverter (`25`) frame `12 03` matches EWX14: `[2..3]` & 0x7FFF motor rpm, `[6]` water temperature (rose to the 30 °C setpoint while washing), `[19..20]` signed target rpm.
The max target during a 1200 rpm spin was 12600 motor rpm, so the motor to drum ratio is 10.5.
`[13..14]` is higher with water in the drum, but it also moves with the motor load, so it is not used as a water level.

Counters (`56 03 02` / `56 03 03`) before and after the same cycle: working hours x10 went up by 10, and three cycle counters (851, 819, 413) each went up by 1.

Node `2B` identifies as `SWA000006` (`11 00` frame). It sends `20 03 ...` every 500 ms while the machine is on but idle and stops when a program starts.

Differences from EWX14: start delay is at `[11]`, the door lock bit is inverted, the heartbeat is `5F 00`, and program numbers follow this model's selector.
